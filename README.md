# BHA Webcam Microscope

This repo contains the designs and source files of a **DIY Webcam Microscope**. This device can be used to observe microscope slides on your PC and play biotic games. 

On April 13, 2019 a workshop was conducted at the Mini Green Maker Faire Rhein-Waal. The assembly guide that was used there can be found in this repository as well.
